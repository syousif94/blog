It's often useful to show users keywords they can filter by, like the most popular hashtags in the last few hours or the most common types of restaurants between two coordinates on a map. [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co) makes these kinds of aggregations easy. I will be demonstrating with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Setup Elasticsearch for Node

First, get elasticsearch from npm:

```bash
npm install @elastic/elasticsearch
```

Then, create a file somewhere in your source code directory and instantiate an Elasticsearch client:

```js
// src/elasticsearch.js

const { Client } = require("@elastic/elasticsearch");

const client = new Client({ node: "http://{ELASTICSEARCH_URL}:9200" });

module.exports = client;
```

### Index Data

There are two primary data types for text in Elasticsearch, `text` and `keyword`. `text` is used for full text searches, like if you want to find paragraphs that contain a certain phrase. `keyword` is meant for short, important data like tags or usernames. To tell Elasticsearch how it should treat our data, we need to create a mapping. Pretend we are storing restaurants with the following mapping:

```js
// src/index.js

const client = require("./elasticsearch");

async function createMapping() {
  await client.indices.create(
    {
      index: "restaurants",
      body: {
        mappings: {
          properties: {
            name: { enabled: false },
            foods: { type: "keyword" },
            lngLat: { type: "geo_point" }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    { ignore: [400] }
  );
}
```

Next we need to insert some restaurants into Elasticsearch:

```js
// src/index.js

const client = require('./elasticsearch')
async function createMapping() {...}

async function insertData() {
  const dataset = [
    {
      name: 'Chipotle',
      foods: ['burrito', 'taco', 'quesadilla', 'salad']
    },
    {
      name: `Torchy's Tacos`,
      foods: ['taco', 'queso', 'guac']
    },
    {
      name: `Cane's`,
      foods: ['chicken tenders', 'chicken sandwich']
    },
    {
      name: 'Chick-fil-a',
      foods: ['chicken sandwich', 'chicken nuggets']
    }
  ]

  const body = dataset
    .flatMap(restaurant => {
      return [
        { index: { _index: 'restaurants' } },
        restaurant
      ]
    })

  /** bulk expects body to look like
   * [
   *  { index: { _index: 'restaurants' } },
   *  { name, foods, location },
   *  { index: { _index: 'restaurants' } },
   *  { name, foods, location },
   * ]
   * flatMap just returns a flattened array for every item in the dataset
  */

  await client.bulk({ refresh: true, body })
}
```
